// To override the build settings supplied in these build config files, copy the xcconfig files to a location 
// outside the working copy and modify the settings to your liking. Then add the following source tree to your
// Xcode prefs:
//
//		iMediaConfig		iMediaConfig		/path/to/modified/xcconfig/files
//
// You may have to relaunch XCode and clean you project to build with the new settings. Please verify that Xcode
// is now referencing your own set of xcconfig files.
