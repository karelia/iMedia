#pragma mark ABSTRACT
/*
 This class provides parsing functionality that is common to some media data storages provided by Apple
 (such as iPhoto and Aperture). Public property list files of iPhoto and Aperture share a lot of structure
 (specifically regarding faces data) so you can utilize this intermediate class to share corresponding
 functionality between iPhoto and Aperture parsers (and maybe other parsers to come).
 
 ATTENTION: This is an abstract class. Do not use an instance of this class, but use a specific subclass
            like IMBiPhotoParser or IMBApertureParser instead...
