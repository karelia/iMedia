 This class provides synchronous access to properties of certain objects of Apple's MediaLibrary framework that by design reliably return values only asynchronously through KVO ("mediaSources" and friends).

 Synchronous access to these properties is of great value for MediaLibrary-based iMedia parsers since parsers must return values synchronously to their client classes.
