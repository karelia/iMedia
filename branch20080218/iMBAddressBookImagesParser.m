 The idea here is to show images of people in your address book who have pictures associated with them.
 
 SORT OF WORKS, BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS:
 
 * We really should parse all the cards into the top level, since some records may not exist
   in groups.  (The AddressBookParser would have the same issue).
 
 * There is no image path, since the images are created from data, so you can't drag.
   I'm not sure how to deal with this - maybe any place that asks for the image path (other than
   for generating the thumbnail, which we already have) should check if there is an image path,
   and if not, writing it out to a temporary file or something.
 
 * Since entries can live in more than one group, the combined view should only show the entries
   ONCE but we're seeing multiple versions of the same people.
