This document describes the restructuring of the iMediaBrowser to allow media specific sub-views to be easily
embedded in existing windows.

This change moves much of the "view" functionality that is currently in iMediaBrowser into a new class named 
iMBAbstractView with subclasses for each media type. To do this, the outline container (outline view + popup) 
and tree controller is no longer shared between various media types. Instead there is a copy in the 
iMBAbstractView subclass (and subsequently in each subclass for each media type).

iMediaBrowser becomes a window controller containing a tabless tab view containing various iMBAbstractView 
subclasses. Switching tabs is still handled/supported by the toolbar.

iMBAbstractView subclasses represent the browser + controls + media specific view for each media type, for 
instance iMBPhotosView and iMBMusicView, etc. Existing media specific NIBs (such as iPhoto.nib) are 
unchanged but are now contained in iMBAbstractViews subclasses.

The iMBAbstractController and all of its derived classes have been removed, replaced by the iMBAbstractView
hierarchy.

The media specific NIB files were changed only to reflect their media view specific owner instead of the controller.

Since iMediaBrowser is no longer the primary class, a new class 'iMediaConfiguration' is now used for configuration.
The iMediaBrowser now forwards much of its configuration methods to the configuration object to maintain backwards
compatibility.

The iMediaBrowserProtocol was changed to reflect the new architecture.

There are some cases where outlets have been renamed.

For those interested in comparing the old code to the new code, the bulk of the changes are in iMediaBrowser.
The code in iMediaBrowser has been split out into iMBAbstractView and iMediaConfiguration or left in place.

It is also possible to compare the older iMBxxxController.m with iMBxxxView.m with a command something like this:
diff -u iMBPhotosView.m ../imedia-trunk/iMBPhotosController.m

Known issue: custom parsers are not loaded.

Known issue: no attempt was made to update the previously and still non-working contacts view.

Known issue: many minor code formatting issues to make diff easier to read.
