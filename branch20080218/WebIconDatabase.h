    @class WebIconDatabase
    @discussion Features:
        - memory cache icons at different sizes
        - disk storage
        - icon update notification
        
        Uses:
        - WebIconLoader to cache icon images
        - UI elements to retrieve icons that represent site URLs.
        - Save icons to disk for later use.
 
    Every icon in the database has a retain count.  If an icon has a retain count greater than 0, it will be written to disk for later use. If an icon's retain count equals zero it will be removed from disk.  The retain count is not persistent across launches. If the WebKit client wishes to retain an icon it should retain the icon once for every launch.  This is best done at initialization time before the database begins removing icons.  To make sure that the database does not remove unretained icons prematurely, call delayDatabaseCleanup until all desired icons are retained.  Once all are retained, call allowDatabaseCleanup.
    
    Note that an icon can be retained after the database clean-up has begun. This just has to be done before the icon is removed. Icons are removed from the database whenever new icons are added to it.
    
    Retention methods can be called for icons that are not yet in the database.
